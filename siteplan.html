            <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>
            
            <p>The purpose of this site is offer volunteer service to those 
                willing to give and offer this service:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Have I done any good in the world today?<br>
                Have I helped anyone in need?<br>
                Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?<br>
                If not, I have failed indeed.
            </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This a question asked that a times we feel a little prink in 
                our hearts when we are asked, but I think I have an answer 
                to that question with the creation of a site that can link those
                who want volunteer service with those who want to give volunteer service.</p>
